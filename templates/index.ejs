        <p class="description">
            A quiz is a form of game or mind sport, in which the players (as individuals or in teams) attempt to answer
            questions correctly. In some countries, a quiz is also a brief assessment used in education and similar
            fields to measure growth in knowledge, abilities, and/or skills.
            Quizzes are usually scored in points and many quizzes are designed to determine a winner from a group of
            participants â€“ usually the participant with the highest score.
